\title{title: Over-representation analysis with clusterProfiler
purpose: Given a set of genes (significant genes from differential gene expression analysis), we want to
assess whether they are associated with any pathways in Reactome, GO, or KEGG

Perform GO Enrichment Analysis with clusterProfiler}
\usage{
prepare_clusterProfiler_geneLists(
  dgea_res_file,
  pValCutoff = 0.05,
  pValCol = "padj",
  log2FCCutoff = 1,
  log2FCCol = "log2FoldChange",
  geneID_fromType = "SYMBOL",
  geneID_toType = "SYMBOL",
  org = "org.Hs.eg.db"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{dgea_res_file}{character. Path to the DGEA result file (.csv, .tsv, or .txt).}

\item{pValCutoff}{numeric. Adjusted p-value cutoff to filter significantly differentially expressed genes.}

\item{pValCol}{character. Name of the column in the DGEA file that contains adjusted p-values (e.g., "padj").}

\item{log2FCCutoff}{numeric. log2FC cutoff to filter significantly differentially expressed genes.}

\item{log2FCCol}{character. Name of the column in the DGEA file that contains log2FoldChange (e.g., "log2FC" or "log2FoldChange").}

\item{geneID_fromType}{character. Gene ID type in DGEA results}

\item{geneID_toType}{character. Gene ID type to convert to}

\item{org}{character. organism to use for conversion (options come from bitr())}
}
\value{
A clusterProfiler \code{enrichResult} object containing GO enrichment results.
}
\description{
This function reads differential gene expression results and performs GO enrichment
analysis using the clusterProfiler package.
}
\examples{
# Example usage:
# result <- perform_enrichGO("deseq2_results.csv", 0.05, "padj")
